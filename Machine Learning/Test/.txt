 Differences Between Descriptive and Inferential Statistics


     Descriptive Statistics	                                                                                 Inferential Statistics
1. Summarizes and describes features of a dataset	                                             1. Makes inferences and predictions about a population
2. Uses measures like mean, median, mode, range, etc.	                                         2. Uses statistical tests and models
3. Focuses on past data	                                                                       3. Focuses on future predictions
4. Deals with known data	                                                                     4. Deals with unknown data
5. No hypothesis testing	                                                                     5. Involves hypothesis testing
6. Usually uses the entire population or dataset	                                             6. Uses samples to make generalizations
7. Provides a snapshot of data	                                                               7. Provides insights beyond the data
8. No uncertainty involved	                                                                   8. Involves a degree of uncertainty
9. Data is presented in graphs, tables, etc.	                                                 9. Results are presented with confidence intervals
10. Used for data visualization and summarization	                                            10. Used for making predictions and decisions
